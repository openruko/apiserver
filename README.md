# Api Server - The oracle of the dyno world

## Introduction

The apiserver is the central server and API endpoint for OpenRuko, it is written in Node.js
and uses PostgreSQL to persist state.  It exposes methods via a restful API to query and
manipulate the state of the system, dyno hosts call in periodically to pick up jobs which 
we try to distribute fairly by holding on to each request for a small amount of time in 
order to determine the least burden dyno node. The API tries to aims to be compatible with Heroku 
client tools, and whilst certain features such as addons, ssl certs aren't support this 
is an ongoing effort. 

## Requirements

Tested on Linux 3.2 using node 0.8 and postgreSQL 9.1.

On a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 LTS instance:  

PostgreSQL 9.1:  
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL
(after installing, createdb root is handy)

```
apt-get install postgresql postgresql-client
apt-get install postgresql-contrib-9.1 # required for pycrypto hstore etc..
apt-get install python-software-properties # required by add-apt-repository
```

Node.js 0.8.x is not available in available Ubuntu repositories, however Ric Harvey
provides a PPA that works very well, following the instructions onsite adding the
relevant lines to /etc/apt/sources.list

```
add-apt-repository ppa:richarvey/nodejs
apt-get update
apt-get install nodejs npm libssl0.9.8
```

Please share experiences with CentOS, Fedora, OS X, FreeBSD etc... 

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/openruko/apiserver.git apiserver  
cd apiserver  
```

Install node.js dependencies:
```
make init
```

Create database (apologises for the robustness of the db boostrap script)
```
cd postgres
./setup
```

You'll additionally need to create a postgres user/pass and grant perms for db
and to openruko_api and openruko_data schema, add these details and credentials 
to the environment variables to launch apiserver, see ./debug.launch for example.

Example (not recommended on an open server for obvious security reasons):

```
CREATE USER openruko WITH PASSWORD 'openruko'
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE openruko to openruko;
GRANT usage ON SCHEMA openruko_api to openruko;
GRANT usage ON SCHEMA openruko_data to openruko;
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA openruko_data TO openruko;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA openruko_data TO openruko;
GRANT SELECT ON openruko_api.boss_instance TO openruko;
GRANT SELECT ON openruko_api.current_release TO openruko;
```

Create certs for the rendezvous endpoint (tls):
```
make certs
```


## Environment Variables

apiserver/bin/apiserver will check for the presence of several environment variables,
these must be configured as part of the process start - e.g. configured in 
supervisord or as part of boot script see ./debug.launch for example

* BASE_HOST - base host of the API server (e.g. localhost:5000)
* BASE_PROTOCOL- base protocl of the API server (e.g. http)
* PORT - TCP port to bind server to (<1024 require superuser privileges)
* PRIVATE_KEY - Path to private key in pem format (can be relative to project root)
* PUBLIC_KEY - Path to public key in pem format (can be relative to project root)
* S3_KEY - Your AWS S3 key for the repo and slug bucket
* S3_SECRET - Your AWS S3 secret for the repo and slug bucket
* S3_BUCKET - Name of S3 bucket to store slugs and repos

## Help and Todo 

Loads to do on this part, not limited to:

* Improve setup scripts and find a path to database migrations.

* Missing features

* In updatestate handle logic to handle failed instance, retries, and kills - if
dyno is not consistent with state in database.
